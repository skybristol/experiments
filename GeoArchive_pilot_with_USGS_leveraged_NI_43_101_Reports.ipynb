        "# Project Prospectus\n",
        "Exploring the structure and function of a GeoArchive in the USGS by developing prototype capability with the NI 43-101 Technical Reports*\n",
        "\n",
        "# Background and Goal\n",
        "The geosciences across USGS Missions and Programs leverage a broad array of both structured and unstructured data and information sources. Many of these are critical as sources of knowledge of geologic processes, recorded observations and measurements, identification of geologic features, and other details that make their way into our research and synthesized data products from geologic maps to energy and mineral assessments. In this project, we will explore the establishment of an active archive for an array of digital objects that are static from the point in time of when they were created or acquired but need to be continually built upon and serve as viable and accessible source material.\n",
        "\n",
        "Historically, many of data and information source materials are managed as collections of files on local machines or network file servers, often accompanied by structured or looseform inventory information and other documentation. Data and information extracted from the original source material takes many different forms with often poorly documented provenance or processing steps between original source material and the information used in scientific analysis and interpretation. The methods and techniques used to evaluate especially unstructured or very non-standardized structured data and information sources are most often not aided by any more advanced text and data mining methods and technologies.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aims to address a foundational part of this problem by establishing a digital archive and source materials management solution. We are proposing to give it a name, identify, and presence in our overall architecture but build it entirely on existing infrastructure and with tools readily available in the USGS. The solution will meet the following major criteria:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Provide an online presence for digital files of various kinds, allowing for download access through various protocols on the web and access from cloud resources for efficient processing through various types of tools.\n",
        "2. Provide a persistent, resolvable identifier for each unique artifact in the system that can be visited by humans, referenced/linked to effectively by other artifacts and data systems, and interfaced with by software code.\n",
        "3. Provide a flexible system for the best available metadata about artifacts in the archive that enables the documentation to be improved and made more robust through time.\n",
        "4. Provide methods for search and retrieval of archive materials through various means, including map interfaces for georeferenced materials.\n",
        "5. Provide a capacity to house and provide both open, publicly available archive materials as well as sensitive materials requiring authenticated and authorized access controls.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Approach\n",
        "While an exhaustive development and examination of system requirements could indicate other and better technology options, there is an overall need to move ahead with a capability that introduces necessary functionality in support of ongoing work in the Mineral Resources Program. As such, we plan to leverage existing capability readily available to us via the ScienceBase catalog and digital repository platform but conduct the work in a way that does not lock in that particular solution for the long term. We will make design and implementation decisions toward flexibility to migrate between alternate solutions through time.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will focus development initially on the NI 43-101 technical reports that have been collected by USGS Mineral Resources Program staff over some time to support mineral resource assessments and contributions to structured data assets. These reports are all single PDF documents, sometimes versioned through time for the same target mineral development asset, retrieved through an online portal system or alternate location on the web. The reports are essentially \"web transients,\" meaning they are not already archived and maintained by any other single entity as a sustained resource, and so USGS staff have created their own internal archive for reference purposes. This current archive consists of two different folder/file structures on internal network servers that have adopted a relatively consistent file-naming convention that provides some useful identification information along with a spreadsheet for part of the collection containing additional metadata, including geospatial coordinates representing the site of the subject mineral development asset.\n",
        "\n",
        "A small portion of the necessary metadata for the files is inherent in how the files have been named and organized in their respective folder structures or in the digital file header information. However, the majority of meaningful descriptive content comes from the file contents themselves. Some of the more important project/site identification information from the document contents has been pulled into an inventory spreadsheet that we will build a meta-model around. Other useful content that could be extracted from the document content will be explored through further work, starting with this project but extending beyond, in text mining/extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Within the scope of this project we will attempt to get started on this exploration by teaming with the [GeoDeepDive](https://geodeepdive.org) project at U. Wisconsin-Madison, working with them to feed a representative sample of the NI 43-101 reports through their processing engines. GeoDeepDive and some related capabilities is evolving as a platform for operationally extracting useful data content out of \"print\" document sources, including several overall areas of important functionality for our purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Conversion of PDF text content, which is really only a \"picture\" of the text, into readable text that can be further parsed and processed. If we don't have the GeoDeepDive engine to run this process, we would want to employ similar methods on our own.\n",
        "2.   Full text indexing of the extracted/converted PDF text content into an Elasticsearch engine that supports different types search and discovery methods through the various GeoDeepDive APIs.\n",
        "3.   Processing through the search index to identify where key terms of interest to much of our work (e.g., geologic formations, rock types, etc.) are found within the texts and an API that returns the snippets of text around these words. This helps us both hone in on a set of documents of interest within the larger corpus and bring certain discovered terms of interest back into our own metadata documentation for categorization purposes (e.g., identifying the mineral commodities described within a particular document).\n",
        "4.   Pre-processing the full text of documents into a data structure optimized for natural language processing against which NLP models such as named entity recognition and others can be developed and run at scale. Some routines that are of interest to USGS geoscience work have been developed already and can be built upon. This will be important as we look to do more complex things like tease out structured data from narrative sections in disclosure reports documenting the geologic settings of mineral projects.\n",
        "5.   A newer processing engine called COSMOS is in development with promising early results. COSMOS extracts tables, figures, and equations from documents and is able to parse many of those into readable digital data structures. While this is a sensitive part of the project for proprietary, copyrighted materials, we may be able to employ it to good effect for the public domain documents we will be dealing with in this project to provide more robust, usable access to important tables and figures from the reports. Further work is needed in this part of the project to build methods to build out a usable metamodel for the extracted artifacts, something we may be able to contribute to for things like the fairly well structured and consistent disclosure reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Project Team\n",
        "We are deliberately working to develop a small project team with the majority of the resources contributed through a dedicated pilot effort funded by the Energy and Minerals Mission Area (EMMA). The project will be conducted fully in the open with regular opportunities for input welcome from anyone with an interest.\n",
        "\n",

        "* Developer: Jay Shah (contractor from the USGS Cloud Hosting Solutions group, dedicated to working on EMMA development tasks)\n",
        "* Subject Matter Experts: Jane Hammarstrom and Mike Zientek are providing expertise and insights on how the disclosure reports are used in the minerals assessment process; Carma San Juan, E.G. Boyce, Nick Karl, and Peter Schweitzer are all providing expertise on how the overall archive needs to be structured and managed\n",
        "* CSS Collaborators: Lindsay Powers and Mikki Johnson will be working to make logical connections from the GeoArchive concept to broader USGS needs under the Data Preservation Program, specifically toward documenting methods and practices learned in this project\n",
        "* Student Interns: Interns from the Geo-Launchpad Program at UNAVCO will be working through a summer program and will assist with transferring materials into the archive and working through to enhance metadata\n",
        "\n",
        "# Timeline and Project Process\n",
        "Much of the groundwork has been laid for the GeoArchive with capability already inherent in ScienceBase. This should allow us to build out a basic working solution fairly quickly with at least basic functionality. With that groundwork laid, we anticipate that the minimum viable products can be fully completed in 45 days or less from project start. All specific tasks, issues, and work of the project will be conducted within an open and transparent code project so that any stakeholder can check in on work in progress and weigh in on issues in need of subject matter expertise. The small project team will check in on video at least once weekly to work through any outstanding issues. Where we do run into challenges based on ScienceBase as a core dependency, we will work to ensure these are documented as backlog items for consideration within that project or otherwise resolved through some other means."

To accommodate organizing concepts such as the geopoloitical boundary context used in the inventory spreadsheet used for USMIN. For those purposes, we will employ the tagging structure and other metadata properties that produce facets within the ScienceBase Catalog system. The functionality that the hierarchy of collections provides does include the following:\n",

        "# Geoarchive Linked Data\n",
        "Many of the concepts that are going to be used to organize and work with our GeoArchive are \"things\" that are going to be commonly used and found in other parts of our data system. As such, this is an opportunity for us to start working out how we logically link information from across our data systems together. An increasingly important way of doing this is to align key concepts in data with some type of reference source (via a persistent, resolvable identifier) such that the same concept in another data collection can be unambiguously identified because it shares the same reference identifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "What we are essentially working to do in this exercise is to create functionally linked data between logically independent databases, actively examining each dataset for anything that can be linked to common concepts or other datasets. Much of the time, the linking elements are found within metadata, which can be represented in the data themselves or housed in some adjacent documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our particular case, we're dealing with something fairly simple in terms of the inventory spreadsheet we pulled in above, but it still contains several key pieces of information that will likely be found in many other parts of our data system. There are a couple of basic geographic location properties that help us orient where mining properties are found (Country and State (US States only)). The Commodities property points to mineral and other names, which are also listed out in an included sheet. It is also likely that the Name property contains either some type of linkable location name or well-established mining property name.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Commodity Name Exploration\n",
        "After initially experimenting with the USGS Thesaurus as a potential point of reference for the commodities that are an aspect of the NI 43-101 reports (the subject of the particular mineral/material exploration project), we talked about needing to use a different primary source. The authoritative source for mineral names used in the geoscience community is the International Mineralogical Association [List of Minerals](https://www.ima-mineralogy.org/Minlist.htm). All we need is a more \"online actionable\" representation of these names that we can link to individually with persistent, resolvable identifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "I am exploring one [potential source](https://catalogue.linked.data.gov.au/index.php/resource/160) maintained by the [Geological Survey of Queensland](https://vocabs.gsq.digital/object?uri=http://linked.data.gov.au/def/minerals). This may be operated in a way that we would consider a reliable resource, but the underlying infrastructure there appears to be somewhat unstable or at least not always reliably accessible.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Wikidata as Clearinghouse Source\n",
        "An option for many concepts that we might leverage is Wikidata, essentially the largest open commons for a linked data enabled knowledge graph. Many different organizations who are doing anything with linked open data on the web are actively developing and operating code that populates Wikidata with key pieces of information needed to make other information systems work better. It can serve as a reference source for many different use cases like ours, providing a global clearinghouse of concepts and everything they can be linked to.\n",
        "\n",
        "Wikidata has a [mineral species](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12089225) with a defined set of properties that references to the IMA list of minerals. There are 5,694 items that are instances of the mineral species class, meaning that there may be 6 mineral species missing or misclassified (subject for further exploration). Looking at our list of \"NONFUEL MINERAL\" commodities from the NI 43-101 inventory, there are some things in there that are not going to be listed as IMA minerals. A little bit of exploration through other classes in Wikidata indicates that we might be able to pull together a reasonable reference vocabulary that could serve our purposes here and elsewhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assembling a Logical Vocabulary Reference\n",
        "While we could hit the Wikidata API live with queries on individual terms, it is useful to assemble a master set of information with a little bit of our own pre-processing and organization to operate against with subsequent queries. This gives us a level of abstraction away from a very large and complex reference source, giving us some stability and freedom of operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "For simplicity, we build a array of objects here that contains a label and reference URL for the source of terms we are going to consult. We include the term label and its Wikidata identifier (URL) and process the list of alternate labels for some of the terms where we are likely to encounter additional terms that we can match against. This information gets dumped to a local cache file here in the Colab notebook, but we might pull this into some other type of online, shared cache in a future iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Wikidata reference source we are building is very simple and tailored for quick term label comparison purposes. As such, we can put all of the logical vocabularies we want to consult together into one structure. The following codeblock provides a configuration principal containing the logical label we want to apply to our sources, the reference URL and identifier for that source, the type of relationships individual terms/concepts have to that source (P31 = instance of; P279 = subclass of), and an indication of whether or not we should include the alternate names/labels for that source. I also created a function to handle the process of querying the Wikidata SPARQL API and putting our list of terms together.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, I included a function that will take a few different parameters and execute a term match against our reference source once that is established. We can use this to create additional properties in our inventory dataframe that will then be used to generate ScienceBase Items and populate them with tags that include explicit references to the associated terms/concepts from Wikidata for further reference."

        "The main subject of the NI 43-101 technical reports is quite specificaly a mineral exploration or development project. The USGS perspective on these reports is somewhat laser focused toward the mineral occurrences that the documentation associated with the projects helps us map and analyze and gain understanding about, but the reports themselves are about the human activity through some institutions to develop mineral resource. In our various data systems like the Mineral Resources Data System and USMIN Mineral Deposit Database, we're dealing with different kinds of entities like sites or geographic features associated with mining or mineral occurrences. Those entities have different meaning and scope with associated descriptive and data properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of how the nomenclature and semantics work in this community, we can sometimes end up with a bit of confusion based on the idea of locality, what it signifies in geology and related fields, and how many different kinds of things can become associated with a geographic location. For this project, we do need to take a slight foray into getting the semantics right for the idea of a \"project\" as it relates to a time-bound mineral development activity that becomes the subject of the reports we're dealing with for this particular archive. The \"Name\" property in the USMIN inventory spreadsheet pulled in above is essentially a shorthand name for the project that has a longer name in the files themselves and can refer to some common vernacular name for a location or a specific mine. For instance, the code block below shows the inventory records for two different files associated with the \"Charlie Uranium Project\" in Wyoming, simply referenced as \"Charlie\" in the spreadsheet. We need a lightweight schema that lets us persistently and consistently identify the projects themselves as something that lives just indendent of the report documents themselves. That will let us do expedient things like link multiple documents in the archive to the same project, indicating my date and/or other means that the report applies to a different period in the lifecycle of the project.\n",
        "\n",
        "Taking an iterative and very lightweight approach, we may well start with the expedient of simply putting a tag (keyword) on items in the archive that's part of a particular \"scheme\" of tags for project names. That simply lets us filter/search on project names to see multiple documents associated with the project without overloading the concept. However, as soon as we set something up like a \"GeoArchive\" as a real going concern that anyone (or at least a lot more people) can access than a simple spreadsheet shared with a few people, it makes using shorthand references like \"Charlie\" a little awkward and in need of some explanation. We are ultimately going to want to build on the simple shorthand reference to projects to assign some additional information about the projects that's needed in our information architecture, reasonable to assemble, and based on acceptable standards and conventions (e.g., even the simplicity of a few elements from the schema.org Event type)."

We could kick the can down the road a little bit till we have more clarity and a few more use cases on the \"project\" concept, at which point we can come back and improve the project references in the GeoArchive to incorporate references to some source of definition and further information."

        "How vital is it that we develop some method for bringing together a reference capability for our data systems (including and beyond the GeoArchive) that has this level of rigor?\n",
        "\n",
        "Our current situation is essentially that each and every instance of some database or information system provides its own vocabularies or enumerated lists of values that each one is using. Some of these might be more robust than others and include definitions or references. Others simply explain what a data field contains and then leave it to the user to decide if there is a relationship to anything else. Sometimes descriptive metadata will describe processing steps that may give some clues as to source material, but this is almost always written for humans and may have missing steps or implicit assumptions that make it difficult to track down specifics. Within a given community like mineral geology, there is perhaps an unspoken assumption that if someone mentions a mineral, then they, of course, must mean the mineral species from the IMA List of Minerals.\n",
        "\n",
        "The real reason that all of this becomes important is that we are increasingly releasing our data \"into the wild\" where it can be picked up, pulled apart, and reassembled in myriad ways - sometimes by humans and increasingly by artificial intelligences and other robots. To the extent that we can embed explicit semantics into our data streams, we both mitigate misuse and promote accelerated appropriate use of our data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Embedding explicit semantics into our data streams is functionally accomplished in the way we are exploring here - including a persistent, resolvable identifier to the agreed upon location of reference for a term along with the label for the term we are using in our context. The hard part is agreeing on what the point(s) of reference should be, and the really hard part can be finding the point of reference to use that is trustworthy and technologically robust enough to be scalable and sustainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Wikidata model is actually a really interesting one to consider for our purposes. On the one hand, it can seem risky to rely on something that is maintained in the global commons where nearly anyone has the potential to influence the content of the system. However, that is also its strength - democratizing the knowledge development space and scaling out to thousands of participants who each hone in on their particular area of expertise and contribute. The vast majority of contributions are based on bots or otherwise bulk processes that turn facts and information from other source material into the Wikidata structure. There are also fairly rigorous safeguards put in place based on a meritocratic system that controls many aspects of the system by debating and carefully crafting the properties of items (anyone can create an item, but properties are determined through a review and debate process).\n",
        "\n",
        "Items (entities) in wikidata are first classified into some logical bucket of like things (e.g., mineral species, chemical elements), which are themselves entities that are classified and described. Each entity can then have any number of claims (or statements) made about the entity. A claim is based on a property, which is another type of entity with parameters and constraints. Claims can have any number of references and qualifiers, and many communities and algorithms base logic on these attributes of claims (e.g., non-referenced claims should be ignored completely in some cases). A particular type of claim can be recorded as related identifiers from other systems (e.g., mineral species items contain relevant identifiers from MinDat). These essentially mean that someone determined that \"this thing in this system is the same as that thing in that system.\" Wikidata also keeps a detailed history of every transaction that has resulted in a change from the creation of an item to each claim and accessible versions at every change, allowing for trust-based choices. (I once got in an interesting argument with an individual who was conducting gender-based research and decided to use a list of common male/female names as their basis for assigning gender values to the Wikidata items for USGS scientists.)\n",

        "We could ignore this problem for now and simply put tags on items in ScienceBase containing our NI 43-101 files, setting them up for navigation and organization purposes but not explicitly tying the terms to any reference source. However, as things tend to go, if we keep kicking the can down the road, we will just continue to compound our problems in the long run. We could figure out a solution to the \"online actionable\" problem of the various logical authorities we already do count on like the IMA list that is operated by some organization that is closer to our domain (government, geoscience, etc.). We could set up our own capability for anything that we need to rely on as long as we can absorb the near and long term costs and risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "I'm interested in further exploring the Wikidata option. What specific \"containers\" of items might we trust for our use? What characteristics of items would we want to check to make sure we can trust them (e.g., [graphite](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5309) is a mineral species that has a reference indicating this was stated in the IMA list from 2019)? Are there other useful properties for entities we might use as reference sources? Would we want to push our own edits and additions to Wikidata as a resource for ourselves and others?"

Information about people and organizations are stored in ScienceBase via \"contacts\" on items. These are classified with a type designation that can give them particular significance (e.g., author or publisher).

        "# Geospatial Information for Projects\n",
        "The spatial location of the projects reported on through the NI 43-101 reports is important for search and discovery in the archive when someone is looking for information applicable to a certain area. The spreadsheet inventory that is serving as part of the input to build the initial archive contains lat/lon properties with the original spatial coordinates found within the files to represent where the project is located as well as some work on validating and improving on these coordinate references. Future work will go into automated processes for extracting geospatial feature information from the documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Within the ScienceBase context for our prototype catalog, we can add point locations (or another type of footprint) to items for each file. This will enable geospatial search within the catalog and will also set up collection-level geospatial services such that the locations of files within an archive collection can be shown on a map. In the long run, we can work on strategies for where and how to store more robust extracted geospatial feature information from text and data mining operations on the files.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following codeblocks present some exploratory work on the geospatial part of building out the archive from existing materials. One of the challenges will be in taking the relatively messy information identifying where projects are located and turning that into information that can be used to effectively create the spatial footprint for the projects. The functions included above and called here provide one part of this, taking a sometimes variable string format for degrees/minutes/seconds and getting it into an actual spatial data format. Once we confirm that we're able to build a valid geometry from the variable provided information, we add this as GeoJSON to our dataframe so that we can call it up later with another specialized function that creates what ScienceBase expects as \"extents.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This will be improved from this crude state in future iterations. We may explore additional functionality with this such as introducing an ability to validate a point location based on some type of check against other contextual information from the report. For instance, if the report lists an approximate point coordinate for the center of the project and then states in text that it is some distance from a population center or some landmark, we could introduce a function to geolocate the landmark, check the distance, and make sure the point is within some reasonable distance of that reference area. As we get toward automated processing, that's the kind of utility our overall sysem will need to help produce more reasonable information."

        "In the GeoArchive project, we're working to get to a fully fledged working prototype in ScienceBase as quickly as we can so that we can figure out if the platform is going to work for us or not. Some early exploration points to some potential snags, mostly in the areas of performance and stability of the ScienceBase platform. There have been multiple challenges in starting to scale an API-based process of building out an initial archive collection for the NI 43-101 reports in the inventory spreadsheet (service disruptions, etc.). We've also encountered challenges with the user interface in terms of basic authentication access and stability in trying to add and edit items using the ScienceBase Item form. Both of these are considered vital areas of functionality that our system will require. Without these routes being stable and fully functional, we really cannot proceed with practical use. We are communicating about our issues with the ScienceBase team and are working toward solutions if they can be achieved.\n",
        "\n",
        "A more distant and not quite as critical problem is the lack of fully production use of cloud storage via ScienceBase for the file contents we'll have in our archive. We would ideally like for the actual file content to live in the USGS CHS cloud space where we can work on methods and techniques that would exploit this content with text and data mining technologies. In the near term, we're going to route the content of the NI 43-101 reports to a third party platform (GeoDeepDive and COSMOS engines through our collaboration with UW-Madison). This can happen throught he simplicity of HTTP access to the file content, driven through the ScienceBase API and irrespective of where the files sit. But if we want to do something beyond what these engines provide on their own, even the simplicity of building a basic full text index from PDF and other content, we will want the files in the cloud."
