        "# Project Prospectus\n",
        "*A new method for integrated commodity statistics data and a cloud-based distribution point to enable expanded utility of the DS140 report*\n",
        "\n",
        "# Background and Goal\n",
        "An initial goal for the USGS National Minerals Information Center toward modernizing data processing and distribution workflows is to transform the Historical Statistics for Mineral and Material Commodities in the United States (aka [DS140 report](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nmic/historical-statistics-mineral-and-material-commodities-united-states)), into a new data model that supports alternative methods for query, reporting, and usage. Initial focus is on the supply-demand statistics, which are distributed as Excel spreadsheets with varying formats, structures, and properties. In the long run, we may come up with a process that works directly from an alternative, more original source for these data to some type of standardized output that we can operate against.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the near term, this notebook presents a proposal to explore what a process would need to consist of to work directly with the data as presented online via the DS140 distribution site linked above. The goal is to produce a dynamic system that will operate in the USGS cloud to transform the existing DS140 data and any new files posted to that \"running\" Data Series into an amalgamated database, complete with individual commodity metadata. This database will be made available via an application programming interface (API) as a mimumum viable product along with documentation for use and a simple user interface that demonstrates the API functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: In the process of pursuing this idea, we may end up either working with a more fundamental and simply structured form of output data that comes from internal systems to the DS140 distribution point, and we may extend our thinking a bit beyond the DS140 to other data that are distributed from NMIC's processes. The size of data and amount of processes needed are not particularly constraining factors. Rather, the level of complexity in the underlying data and the need to work efficiently back and forth between code development/infrastructure deployment and data subject matter expertise will likely be the area of scope limitation.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Approach\n",
        "This notebook lays out a conceptual approach to the problem using Python code and a set of open source libraries to connect to the DS140 inventory of annual commodity statistics source files, read the files from Excel, and process the statistics and individual commodity metadata into an alternative data structure. This provides the basic elements for what could be instantiated as a serverless processing pipeline in the USGS cloud. As part of the project, we will explore options for this basic approach to include native \"extract/transform/load\" utilities as well as an approach using more vendor-agnostic methods and report on relative costs and trade-offs to the alternate methods. The project will also report on characteristics in the underlying source data and how they are currently provisioned to help inform future work at the point of production and release.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code notebook, as a method for documenting a project proposal, is itself an exploration of a new method and way of thinking about problems in data and technology we are seeking to address. Rather than only provide words that describe an idea, the notebook exercises code and processing methods that demonstrate the idea and test feasibility of the approach. If accepted as a project to move forward, the code serves as a starting point, potentially providing working process that can be further developed into a working system. The note sections provide further details about the thinking involved and demonstrate the direction the proposers are seeking to pursue.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Future Implications\n",
        "This project will test applicable design principles being developed toward a future USGS Geoscience Data System architecture. It specifically targets the concept of iterative, incremental development where we seek to take large problems, break them into actionable chunks, and work to produce something that has immediate value while working stepwise to reduce the larger problems. It persues the concept of loose coupling, building a microservice infrastructure that leverages existing data serving infrastructure (simplicity of USGS web distribution) while layering on small tools that can be composed in a different way for some other purpose. These principles will be tested in practice and described in presentation of results to inform their future development.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other aspects of the NMIC data processing and distribution infrastructure may benefit directly from demonstrating this particular approach. Either native tools to the current Amazon Web Services environment in use by the USGS Cloud or something more transportable will demonstrate basic data handling methods applicable to both proprietary and nonproprietary aspects of the NMIC data environment. Techniques and methods developed for this project can be lifted and adapted to other parts of the infrastructure to add incremental value, achieve efficiencies, and produce new types of end user value from the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Project Team\n",
        "We are deliberately working to develop a small project team with the majority of the resources contributed through a dedicated pilot effort funded by the Energy and Minerals Mission Area (EMMA). The project will be conducted fully in the open with regular opportunities for input welcome from anyone with an interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Architect: Sky Bristol (on detail with EMMA designing and future USGS Geoscience Data System)\n",
        "* Developer: Jay Shah (contractor from the USGS Cloud Hosting Solutions group, dedicated to working on EMMA development tasks)\n",
        "* Subject Matter Expert: TBD (lead focal point from NMIC to ensure accuracy in the data processing methodology and end result and production of a viable product from the work)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Timeline and Project Process\n",
        "Much of the groundwork has been laid for EMMA infrastructure like this to be deployed quickly and efficiently into the USGS cloud. This included working out many of the processes needed for infrastructure deployment for both secure and public access and methodology for continuous integration/deployment of code from the USGS GitLab environment. With that groundwork laid, we anticipate that the minimum viable products can be fully completed in 45 days or less from project start. All specific tasks, issues, and work of the project will be conducted within an open and transparent code project so that any stakeholder can check in on work in progress and weigh in on issues in need of subject matter expertise. The small project team will check in on video at least once weekly to work through any outstanding issues."

        "#Property Registry\n",
        "Arguably, the reason for conducting this work is to provide a mechanism whereby the full time series dataset represented in the DS140 report with all commodities is available as a single data system with query capabilities that still allow for any one commodity to be pulled out and examined but also allows for comparative analyses of different kinds across commodities. This process of scraping the web site and pulling all spreadsheet files into a common dataframe has also been built in a different programming language by Ross Manly for his own purposes and is reportedly a somewhat common practice amongst other users of the DS140 information. While syntactically, this process is mostly fairly straightforward (particularly if we resolve a few issues with the current file set), it is semantically complex since each property for each commodity is presumably different until proven otherwise. The property metadata we've pulled together in this initial process forces us to make this assumption, and commodity statistic comparability cannot be supported until we build enough intelligence into the overall system to support it.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this challenge, we are proposing to produce a property registry as a distinct aspect of the system comprised of the information in accompanying documentation files. This will allow us to critically examine specific definitions and details about the properties as a whole together in one place. There may be properties across commodities that can be put together and compared in different ways but with some specific differences that matter in other circumstances. One of the things our combined property registry needs to develop is an understanding of comparable statistics as a source of intelligence in any distribution or processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this initial take on the problem, we introduced the concept of property_uid as a compound identifier, simply putting the commodity name together with the property name. This indicates that while Cesium and Bromine both have a property called \"Production,\" Cesium:Production and Bromine:Production are fundamentally distinct properties. In some circumstances, if units can be made equivalent, it may be reasonable to compare these two properties in analysis, but that intelligence needs to be made explicit in our property registry. This may not ultimately be the most efficient way to characterize these properties, but it is what's necessary at this point because each commodity time series dataset is fundamentally different until made otherwise.\n",
        "\n",
        "One framework that has tackled this problem in an interesting way is the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) from the Univerisity of Colorado-Boulder and their development of [CSDMS Standard Names](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CSN_Metadata_Names). While the CNS names are designed to serve model coupling and interoperability needs and describe fundamentally different things than statistical algorithm outputs, the basic principles are sound, and the important thing is to develop a abstract registry from all of the subsystems where the properties are used to contain the reference definitions and details of the properties. This creates a forcing factor to more critically examine the definitions and develop logical relationships that can be exploited in analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the current DS-140 suite of data, we have statements like the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Cesium:Production 'Production data prior to 1965 are not available. Cesium-bearing ore production data have been reported as “0” since 1965.'\n",
        "* Bromine:Production 'Production is defined as bromine data that are reported as sold or used by primary producers. All data are in terms of contained bromine. Data are reported in the MR, MYB, and the MCS. Data for 2007 to the most recent year are withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data.'\n",
        "* Barite:Production (sold or used) 'Production data are published for only 1927–67, therefore, crude barite (unmanufactured barite) sold or used data are used in place of production data for 1900 to the most recent year. Data are reported in the MR and the MYB. The significant drop in reported production from 1982 to 1983 resulted from a major slump in the oil drilling industry that reduced demand for drilling mud.'\n",
        "\n",
        "At this stage, the statements for each commodity and statistic are simple data notes that contain a mix of information and annotations about the particular time series of values. And in cases like Barite shown above, they include an explanation of a statistical phenomenon observed in the records.\n",
        "\n",
        "A couple of strategies could be explored for building sufficient intelligence into the property registry to support comparability between some commodity statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Come to agreement on higher order common properties and move specific annotations of various types out into a different type of meta-content.\n",
        "* Keep each statistics property as completely independent but introduce another element into the model that indicates specific cases where two independent properties can be effectively analyzed together.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: There seems to be a further issue in parsing some of the text from Word documents with features in what appear to be coming from templates that is not translating through into the programmatic way of reading the files. This will need to be resolved in some way with code or by cleaning up the source content."

For example, secondary production drops out in 1961; stock adjustments drop out in 1940; and exports drop out in 1940 through 1933 then dropped out again in 1927. Primary production drops in 1961. These changes can be seen in the chromium statistics table. There are more subtle changes that cannot be seen in the general category data series. Materials that constitute imports, exports, and stocks change over time. For example, chromite ore contributes to imports over the entire time period while chromium ferroalloy imports were not reported before 1911 and exports were not reported before 1913. In 1989, the Harmonized Tariff System was implemented causing changes in many of the trade material categories.']},\n",

        "# Examining a Single Commodity\n",
        "As a quick test of the entire process that bypasses the issue of comparability between statistics, we can look at a single commodity, lithium, which is a fairly simple case but represents part of the future state we are working to achieve with a morse flexible and transportable data structure that includes the supply-demand statistics themselves along with the essential documentation that needs to carry through into any future form of the data. In the following code blocks we run the processes to pull data and metadata for the particular file, dump those structures out to display, subset the data to years since 1981, and the plot import and export as simple time series.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this process, this is all done in real time from the DS140 web pages using the functions created here. This is a relatively small and straightforward dataset, and so the process of picking the data up from one form and getting them into another is simple and expedient. Toward a production capability, however, it would be useful to run a background process to simply get all of this work done in a process that can be set up to be responsive to new data being posted. As soon as a file is put into the cloud, a watching process is notified to kick off the series of steps needed to transform the data into our target structure."

Production data for 1940–54 include both gross tons of lithium minerals and compound production and Li2O content of these products. Li2O contains 46.46 percent lithium; this information was used to determine lithium content for those years. Because production data for 1940–54 included dilithium sodium phosphate, the average lithium content of domestic production varied from 2.50 percent to 5.20 percent for the period. Most lithium ores average about 2.00 percent and, and dilithium sodium phosphate contains about 10.5 percent lithium.\n",
            "Prior to 1940, the quantities of different lithium-bearing materials were not specified so that assumptions were made to estimate lithium content. Dilithium sodium phosphate was produced during 1938–78, so adjustments were made for 1938 and 1939. Lithium content was estimated as 2.50 percent for 1939 and 2.00 percent for 1938. Production data from 1900 through 1954 were taken from U.S. Bureau of Mines Information Circular 8053 (Schreck, 1961). For 1929, 1931, 1932, and 1955 to the most recent year, production data were withheld to avoid disclosure of individual company confidential data.\n",

Most imports for 1960–88 were mineral concentrates used in ceramics and glass not used to produce lithium compounds. In addition, during this period, the compounds reported as imports varied from year to year. Often the designations were nonspecific, such as compounds, salts, and/or organic salts making the reported lithium contents questionable.  When the U.S. Census Bureau (USCB) began using the Harmonized Tariff Schedule in 1989, lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide imports were specified. Unfortunately, other categories of lithium compounds were combined in nonspecific categories. Since 1989, imports of lithium ores and ore concentrates have not been reported by USCB, although the  remains a major importer of these materials. Lithium metal imports became unavailable also. For these reasons, a large percentage of lithium imports go unreported. Import data are not available for 1900–59.\n",

For 1982–88, USCB reported exports of lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, and other lithium compounds. Data are from the Salient Statistics table in the MYB.
