# experiments
I end up capturing a fair bit of my exploration into various topics and problems via Jupyter Notebooks. This repo is a space for those that replaces an older repo that got kind of out of hand. This one might get out of hand eventually, but I'll try to keep it a little better organized. Anything I post here is open for any other uses anyone might find interesting.

## disclaimer

Though some of the experimentation documented here is associated with my job with the USGS, the ideas and opinions expressed, notation on specific technologies or software tools, and other thoughts are my own and my sole responsibility. This is informal experimentation and open annotation. Anything official makes its way into other products and repos that will be so noted as provisional or released software.
