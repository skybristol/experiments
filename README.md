# experiments
I end up capturing a fair bit of my exploration into various topics and problems via Jupyter Notebooks. This repo is a space for those that replaces an older repo that got kind of out of hand. This one might get out of hand eventually, but I'll try to keep it a little better organized. Anything I post here is open for any other uses anyone might find interesting.

You may be able to use the environment.yml to build an environment to operate some or most of these notebooks. I don't guarantee that it has everything needed by every notebook in terms of the package versions I used at the time I worked through the idea or everything else the environment might need. These are meant as a way to share developing ideas over time. Take them as inspiration for what you may do or an example of the wrong way to do things - please let me know in an issue or some other communication where I could do things better.

## disclaimer

Though some of the experimentation documented here is associated with my job with the USGS, the ideas and opinions expressed, notation on specific technologies or software tools, and other thoughts are my own and my sole responsibility. This is informal experimentation and open annotation. Anything official makes its way into other products and repos that will be so noted as provisional or released software.
