# experiments
I end up capturing a fair bit of my exploration into various topics and problems via Jupyter Notebooks. This repo is a space for those that replaces an older repo that got kind of out of hand. This one might get out of hand eventually, but I'll try to keep it a little better organized. Anything I post here is open for any other uses anyone might find interesting.
